#About
Wololo is a small and nice Wake on LAN web interface. You can easily send Magic Packets to your computers on your local network and check if they are on. 

I made this project because I needed a simple page (running on my Raspberry Pi) to wake my PC or NAS from any device (phone, laptop, ...) at home or through my VPN. I decided to publish it with some little improvements (password protection) as it can be useful to other people. 

Note: The name comes from the game Age of Empires (first one), it's the sound made by the monks when converting other units. The first three letters are also the acronym of Wake-on-LAN.
