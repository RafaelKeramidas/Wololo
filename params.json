You can easily send Magic Packets to your computers on your local network and check if they are on. \r\n\r\nI made this project because I needed a simple page (running on my Raspberry Pi) to wake my PC or NAS from any device (phone, laptop, ...) at home or through my VPN. I decided to publish it with some little improvements (password protection) as it can be useful to other people. \r\n\r\nNote: The name comes from the game Age of Empires (first one), it's the sound made by the monks when converting other units. The first three letters are also the acronym of Wake-on-LAN.\r\n\r\n#Screenshot\r\nhttp://s21.postimg.org/srj0us8yv/wololo.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n#Configuration\r\nThe configuration file is located in the \"includes\" folder under the name config.inc.php. You can edit the basic settings and add/edit/remove computers. Everything is well commented and understandable. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
